## Assignment Details

[22,27,16,2,18,6] -> Insertion Sort
Write the stages of the above array according to the sort type.
Write the Big-O notation.

Time Complexity: After the sequence is sorted, which of the following cases does the number 18 fall into?
1- Average case: The number we are looking for is in the middle
2- Worst case: The number we are looking for is at the end
3- Best case: The number we are looking for is at the beginning of the series.

Write the first 4 steps of [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15.6] according to the Selection Sort.

### Solution

Insertion Sort for [22, 27, 16, 2, 18, 6]:

Step 1: [22, 27, 16, 2, 18, 6]
Step 2: [22, 27, 16, 2, 18, 6]
Step 3: [16, 22, 27, 2, 18, 6]
Step 4: [2, 16, 22, 27, 18, 6]
Step 5: [2, 16, 18, 22, 27, 6]
Step 6: [2, 6, 16, 18, 22, 27]
